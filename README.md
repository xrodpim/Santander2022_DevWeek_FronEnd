# Santander2022_DevWeek_FronEnd

Kind of a very simple front-end bank application built during Santander development week 2022.

From 2022/05/02 to 2022/05/05 I created this simple front-end application to enjoy possibilities with kotlin, Android Studio, Android, Santander examples, etc. It was during Santander development week 2022, a time to put hands on some app programming technologies. It served very well as an initiative to recycle some IT professionals and also as a preparation for the incoming Santander Bootcamp 2022.
